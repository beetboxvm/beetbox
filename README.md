# Beetbox - a pre-provisioned L*MP stack

A VM for local L*MP development, built with Packer, Vagrant + Ansible

Beetbox is essentially a pre-provisioned version of [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/) mainly to speed up initial virtual machine build time, but also to reduce the size of each VM by leveraging [linked clones](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-8.html).

Whilst it contains a set of default feature configuration, it is extremely extensible and almost anything can be overridden/extended with a simple YAML config file.

It is designed to have an instance (VM) per project and be integrated into a VCS like git, so that configuration can be easily shared within a team and a setup of a new project should be as simple as `git clone ...; vagrant up`.

This particular project contains the plumbing to manage the automated build of the pre-provisioned Vagrant base box, so almost all functionality is provided by ansible roles external to this project.

## What's different about this project?

* It's a composer plugin which automatically creates a Vagrantfile.
* You only add config to your project and don't need to manage a fork of the whole provisioning system.
* It uses a pre-provisioned base box so itâ€™s much faster to provision.
* Each new version of the box gets published to Atlas only if all roles are provisioned making the box always stable.
* With linked clones each VM is a small clone of a single master.
* You can reuse the same provisioning system for a CI environment.
* Minimal host machine dependencies.

## Requirements

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.8
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
```
* [Vagrant Auto-network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network)
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network
```

## Quickstart

```
composer require --dev beet/box
vagrant up
```

This will automatically generate a Vagrantfile and the `.beetbox` directory, which will contain a `config.yml` file used to configure overrides.

You can see some examples in [`config.yml`](https://github.com/beetboxvm/beetbox/blob/master/.beetbox/config.yml)

## Updating

```
composer update beet/box
```

Version constraints should automatically keep you to the same minor release. `(0.0.x)`
However, you may need to update your configuation when upgrading minor releases. `(0.x.0)`
See the release notes for more information.

## Drupal Quickstart

To get a simple Drupal 8 site up and running with Beetbox, run the following commands:

```
composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev drupal8 --stability dev --no-interaction
cd drupal8
composer require --dev beet/box
vagrant up
```

After which you can install the site at [http://drupal8.local/install.php](http://drupal8.local/install.php)

or add the following to `./beetbox/config.yml` and run `vagrant provision` to automatically install drupal:

```
drupal_install_site: yes
drupal_account_name: admin
drupal_account_pass: admin
```

For PHP 7 add `php_version: "7.0"` to `./beetbox/config.yml`, then run `vagrant provision`.
