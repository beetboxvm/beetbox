## Overview

Beetbox is a Vagrant configuration that provides your team with a versatile development environment for Drupal projects using Virtualbox for VMs (virtual machines).

## Why use Beetbox?

There are a number of Drupal-focussed Vagrant projects.

* It is leaner than most other projects.
* Supports having a different VM per branch.
* Takes advantage of Vagrant 1.8's to manage VMs for speed and disk efficiency
* Uses ansible for provision but it's not required on the host machine

## Project status

With the release of Virtualbox 1.8 we can report that Beetbox is functional, being used for projects and ready for beta release.
We're looking for experienced Vagrant users to review Beetbox from a usability and architectural perspective. 

Documentation will be released once the feature set is locked down.

Beetbox is primarily maintained by the Drupal Melbourne (Australia) community. Please follow @drupalmelbourne on twitter for announcements.
