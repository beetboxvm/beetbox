# Beetbox - a pre-provisioned L*MP stack

A VM for local L*MP development, built with Packer, Vagrant + Ansible

Beetbox is essentially a pre-provisioned version of [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/) mainly to speed up initial build time but also reduces the size of each VM by leveraging [linked clones](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-8.html).
Whilst it contains a set of default features it is extremely extensable and almost anything can be overridden/extended with a simple YAML config file.
It is designed to have an instance (VM) per project and be integrated into a VCS like git, so config is easily shared within a team and setup of a new project should be as simple as `git clone ... vagrant up`.
This particular project contains the plumbing to manage the automated build of the pre-provisioned Vagrant base box so almost all functionality is provided by ansible roles external to this project.

## Why not use Drupal VM / Vlad?

* You only add config to your project and don't need to manage a fork of the whole provisioning system.
* It uses a pre-provisioned base box so itâ€™s much faster to provision.
* With linked clones each VM is a small clone of a single master.
* You can reuse the same provisioning system for a CI environment.
* Minimal host machine dependencies.

## Requirements

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.8
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)
* [Vagrant Auto-network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network)


## Quickstart

Include this [Vagrantfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beetboxvm/beetbox/master/Vagrantfile) in the root of your project (usually the one which contains index.php) and `vagrant up`.
This will automatically generate the `.beetbox` directory which will contain a `config.yml` file used to configure overrides.
You can see some examples here - [`config.yml`](https://github.com/thom8/beetbox/blob/readme/.beetbox/config.yml)

## Drupal Quickstart

To get a simple Drupal site up and running with Beetbox, run the following commands:

```
drush dl drupal-8.1.2 && cd $_
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beetboxvm/beetbox/master/Vagrantfile > Vagrantfile
vagrant up
```

After which you can install the site at [http://drupal-8.1.2.local/install.php](http://drupal-8.1.2.local/install.php)

or add the following to `./beetbox/config.yml` and run `vagrant provision` to automatically install drupal.

```
drupal_install_site: yes
drupal_account_name: admin
drupal_account_pass: admin
```

For PHP 7 add `php_version: "7.0"` then `vagrant provision`
