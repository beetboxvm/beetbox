# Global config.yml

Create `~/.beetbox/config.yml` and add any variables you want to apply to all beetbox projects on your host machine.

Any variables defined here will be overridden by `config.yml` & `local.config.yml` inside the project.

This file is copied into the project as `host.config.yml` so you can see the global variables in the context of the project variable.
